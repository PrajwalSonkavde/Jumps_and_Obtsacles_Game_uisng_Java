Project Overview: Introduce the project as "Obstacles and Jumps," a multiplayer game inspired by "Snake and Ladder" but with a unique GUI and gameplay elements.

Project Structure: Explaination of the structure of the project, including the three main files: "main.java," "players.java," and "board.java. these files are organized in packages to manage classes and dependencies effectively.
    
Gameplay Description: It is like snake and ladder but instead of ladders, animals and objects are present, influencing the promotion or demotion of coins. the game supports multiplayer functionality only with a minimum of two players and a maximum of four players.

Development Process: the game was developed during your second semester of BTech. Entire game was Created from scratch, including the logic and GUI implementation. 
Programming Language used was by using Java skills and showcasing my creativity.
    
Personal Contribution: I was the sole developer of the game. design and implementation of the complete logic and GUI was done including decision statements such as if, else if, and loops.


I am Prajwal Sonkavde, the developer of the "Obstacles and Jumps" game. As a student pursuing BTech, I took on the challenge of creating this game to apply and expand my Java programming skills. Despite my limited knowledge of Java at the time, I was determined to develop something engaging and interactive.
Throughout the development process, I dedicated considerable time and effort to research, design, and implementation. With a focus on creating a unique twist on the classic "Snake and Ladder" game, I replaced the traditional ladders with animals and objects that either promoted or decreased the player's coin position by 1-30 steps. The game supports multiplayer functionality, allowing a minimum of two and a maximum of four players to compete against each other.
In building "Obstacles and Jumps," I leveraged various programming constructs such as decision statements (if, else if) and loops to develop the game's logic. By carefully considering each player's actions and the consequences of encountering different obstacles and objects, I ensured an exciting and dynamic gameplay experience.
It's worth noting that during the development of this project, I faced the challenge of working with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). I successfully incorporated graphical elements using Java's Swing library, enhancing the visual appeal of the game. Additionally, I made sure to use copyright-free images to maintain the project's integrity and professionalism.
This project allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in Java programming and game development, pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and showcasing my creativity and problem-solving skills.
